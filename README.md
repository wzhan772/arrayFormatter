# arrayFormatter
A C program that formats the elements given an array

Write a program to accept integers separated by spaces, place the integers into an array, and work on the integers found in the array
Your program will behave as follows.
Ask the user for how many integers they will provide
The user must provide a minimum of 5 integers and a maximum of 12.
Print the number the user gave you and size of the array in bytes (using sizeof)
Prompt the user for the list of integers
Each integer must be separated by spaces. If the user does not provide a valid integer, or if the user does not provide enough integers, prompt the user for the entire list of integers again (This is going to be optional instead. If you can accommodate an error like this, then great, otherwise, you can assume the user will not lie.)
Part 1
Print out:
The elements of the array and which position they are in
Part 2
Print out:
The largest value in the array
Part 3
Print out:
The elements of the array in reverse order
Part 4
Print out:
The sum of all values in the array
Part 5
Print out:
The elements of the array from largest to smallest (descending order)
Part 6
Print out:
The elements of the array except the first and last element are swapped
Each part should be implemented as a function. Therefore, your program should have a main function and at least 6 functions
Each part works independently of the rest. In other words, no part should manipulate the original array itself.
Your program should follow good programming styles, i.e. write clear code, choose good variable names, use appropriate functions, make proper comments, etc.
